## **Description**

The Todo Application is a simple and responsive app built using React and Redux. It allows users to manage a list of todo items, including adding, updating, and deleting tasks. Additionally, the app fetches and displays a list of employees from the [DummyJSON API](https://dummyjson.com/users), allowing users to view the employee details in a separate route.

This project showcases the use of React hooks, Redux for state management, and React Router for navigation between different views.
